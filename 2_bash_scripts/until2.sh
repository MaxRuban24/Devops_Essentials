#- create a script that does the following:

#reads a filename from user input
#combines specified file with itself until it reaches a size greater than 1024 KB
# - create a file using head -c 4KB /dev/urandom > file.txt command
# - execute your script passing the file you've just created


# reading the file name from console and redirect output to the variable 'FILE'
read -r -p "Please, enter filename: " FILE

# creating a file with 'head -c 4KB /dev/urandom > file.txt' command
head -c 4KB /dev/urandom > $FILE
